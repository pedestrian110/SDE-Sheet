  üß† Problem: Matrix Chain Multiplication

  You're given an array `arr[]` of size n, where the i-th matrix has dimensions:
  Matrix_i = (arr[i-1] x arr[i])

  Goal: Find the minimum number of scalar multiplications needed to multiply the entire chain of matrices.

  üîç Approach: Dynamic Programming (Bottom-Up)

  1. Let `dp[i][j]` represent the minimum number of multiplications needed to multiply
     matrices from index `i` to `j` (1-based indexing of matrices).

  2. Initialize:
     - For all i, dp[i][i] = 0 ‚Üí cost of multiplying one matrix is zero.

  3. Build the solution using increasing chain lengths `len` from 2 to n-1:
     - For each sub-chain starting at i and ending at j = i + len - 1:
         - Try every possible partition point k between i and j:
           dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] + arr[i-1]*arr[k]*arr[j])
         - This breaks the problem into left and right matrix products and adds the cost of multiplying the result.

  4. The final result is dp[1][n-1], i.e., minimum cost to multiply all matrices from 1 to n-1.
